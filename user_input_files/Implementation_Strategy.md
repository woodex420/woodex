      external_id: contact['Contact ID'],
      first_name: contact['First Name'],
      last_name: contact['Last Name'],
      email: contact['Email']?.toLowerCase(),
      phone: standardizePhone(contact['Phone']),
      company_name: contact['Company'],
      lead_score: parseInt(contact['Lead Score']) || 0,
      status: mapStatus(contact['Status']),
      created_at: new Date(contact['Created Date'])
    };
    
    // Validate before insertion

UNION ALL
SELECT 'Activities', COUNT(*) FROM activities;

-- Check for data anomalies
SELECT 
  'Duplicate Emails' as check_type,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM contacts
WHERE email IN (
  SELECT email 
  FROM contacts 
  GROUP BY email 
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
);
