By executing this plan, WoodEx will not only capture a significant market share but also set new standards for innovation and customer value in the industry.

## 1. Current State Analysis

WoodEx has successfully developed and launched a state-of-the-art B2B e-commerce platform that serves as the foundation for our future growth. This platform is a testament to our commitment to technological innovation and operational excellence.

### 1.1. Technology and Platform Capabilities

*   **3D Visualization:** Our proprietary real-time 3D product visualization and configuration engine, built with React Three Fiber and Three.js, offers a sub-200ms response time, allowing for seamless and instantaneous product customization. This is our single most significant technological advantage.
*   **Dynamic Quotation System:** A sophisticated, rules-based quotation engine supports dynamic pricing, bulk discounts, and automated GST calculations, with the ability to export quotations in PDF format.
*   **Authentication and Access Control:** The platform features role-based authentication, enabling different user roles and permissions for a multi-tenant B2B environment.

*   **Admin Dashboard:** A comprehensive admin dashboard is fully operational, allowing for efficient management of products, orders, users, and platform settings.

### 1.2. Product Portfolio

Our current product portfolio consists of 56 SKUs across 11 categories, primarily focused on the office furniture segment. This curated selection allows us to cater to the needs of our initial target market while providing a solid foundation for future expansion.

### 2.1. Market Size and Growth

The market dynamics are highly favorable for WoodEx's strategic ambitions:

*   **B2C Market:** The B2C furniture market in Pakistan is projected to reach **US$583.7 million in 2025** and is expected to grow steadily.
*   **Office Furniture Segment:** The office furniture segment is a key growth driver, with a projected **CAGR of 6.2% from 2025 to 2031**.
