# Workspace.AE Design System Research Plan

## Task Overview
Extract and document the complete design system from workspace.ae website to recreate their aesthetic for the Woodex Master Platform.

## Research Objectives
1. **Complete Color Palette Analysis**
   - [x] Extract primary colors with hex codes
   - [x] Identify secondary colors
   - [x] Document accent colors
   - [x] Note any gradient usage
   - [x] Capture semantic colors (success, warning, error, info)

2. **Typography System Documentation**
   - [x] Identify all font families used
   - [x] Document font sizes and scaling
   - [x] Extract font weights
   - [x] Note text styles and hierarchies
   - [x] Capture line heights and letter spacing

3. **Layout Patterns Analysis**
   - [x] Document grid systems used
   - [x] Extract spacing values and scales
   - [x] Analyze component layouts
   - [x] Note container widths and responsive breakpoints

4. **UI Components Inventory**
   - [x] Document button styles and variations
   - [x] Extract form elements (inputs, selects, checkboxes)
   - [x] Analyze navigation patterns
   - [x] Document card designs
   - [x] Capture modal/dialog designs
   - [x] Note any other components

5. **Design Patterns Analysis**
   - [x] Document visual hierarchy principles
   - [x] Extract spacing rules
   - [x] Analyze component patterns
   - [x] Note interaction states (hover, active, focus)

6. **Responsive Behavior Documentation**
   - [x] Identify breakpoint values
   - [x] Document responsive adaptations
   - [x] Note mobile-specific patterns

7. **Brand Identity Elements**
   - [x] Extract logo usage guidelines
   - [x] Document brand colors
   - [x] Note visual identity elements
   - [x] Capture imagery style

## Methodology
1. Initial website exploration and content extraction
2. Systematic visual analysis of all pages
3. Component library identification
4. Pattern documentation with examples
5. Responsive behavior testing
6. Brand identity analysis

## Output Deliverable
Complete design system documentation saved to `docs/workspace-ae-design-system.md` with:
- Color palette swatches with hex codes
- Typography specimens
- Component specifications
- Layout patterns
- Responsive guidelines
- Brand identity assets
- Code-ready specifications for implementation

## Quality Standards
- Extract exact hex codes and measurements
- Provide visual examples where possible
- Document all discovered variations
- Include practical implementation notes
- Ensure 100% completeness of all requested elements
